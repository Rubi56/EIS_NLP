Braatz, Simon Engelke",2023,"cs.LG, cond-mat.mtrl-sci","Analysis of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data for electrochemical systems often consists of defining an Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM) using expert knowledge and then optimizing the model parameters to deconvolute various resistance, capacitive, inductive, or diffusion responses. For small data sets, this procedure can be conducted manually; however, it is not feasible to manually define a proper ECM for extensive data sets with a wide range of EIS responses. Automatic identification of an ECM would substantially accelerate the analysis of large sets of EIS data. We showcase machine learning methods to classify the ECMs of 9,300 impedance spectra provided by QuantumScape for the BatteryDEV hackathon. The best-performing approach is a gradient-boosted tree model utilizing a library to automatically generate features, followed by a random forest model using the raw spectral data. A convolutional neural network using boolean images of Nyquist representations is presented as an alternative, although it achieves a lower accuracy. We publish the data and open source the associated code. The approaches described in this article can serve as benchmarks for further studies.

This paper introduces two new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores, chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values. Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit components, making log-B as a strong alternative.

When applied to the on-line monitoring in the context of in-field applications, the disturbances, drifts and sensor noise may cause severe distortions in the evaluated spectra, especially in the low-frequency part. Failure to ignore the random effects can result in misinterpreted spectra and, consequently, in misleading diagnostic reasoning. This fact has not been often addressed in the research so far. In this paper, we propose an approach to the quantification of the spectral uncertainty, which relies on evaluating the uncertainty of the equivalent circuit model (ECM). We apply the computationally efficient variational Bayes (VB) method and compare the quality of the results with those obtained with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Namely, MCMC algorithm returns accurate distributions of the estimated model parameters, while VB approach provides the approximate distributions. By using simulated and real data we show that approximate results provided by VB approach, although slightly over-optimistic, are still close to the more realistic MCMC estimates. A great advantage of the VB method for online monitoring is low computational load, which is several orders of magnitude lower compared to MCMC. The performance of VB algorithm is demonstrated on a case of ECM parameters estimation in a 6 cell solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack.

In this paper, we utilize electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data from 5 calendar-aged and 17 cycling-aged cells to perform SOH estimation under various operating conditions. The EIS curves are deconvoluted using the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) technique to map them onto a function $\textbf{g}$ which consists of distinct timescales representing different resistances inside the cell. These DRT curves, $\textbf{g}$, are then used as inputs to a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based neural network model for SOH estimation.

Nanostructured block copolymer electrolytes specifically have the potential to provide both good ionic conductivity and good mechanical properties.

Using standard stainless steel blocking electrodes, the impedance of lithium salt-doped poly(isoprene-b-styrene-b-ethylene oxide) (ISO) exhibited a marked decrease upon thermal processing of the electrolyte. In contrast, covering the electrode surface with a low molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) brush resulted in higher and more reproducible conductivity values, which were insensitive to the thermal history of the device. A qualitative model of this effect is based on the hypothesis that ISO surface reconstruction at the different electrode surfaces leads to a change in the electrostatic double layer, affecting electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements.

In this study, we investigate the behavior of a network of distributed-order CPEs, each of which described by a Caputo-type time fractional differential equation relating the current on the CPE to its voltage, but with a non-negative, time-invariant weight function $φ(α)$. The behavior of the distributed-order network in terms of impedance and time-domain response to a constant current excitation is derived for two simple cases of $φ(α)$: (i) $φ(α)=1$ for $0 < α< 1$ and zero otherwise, and $(ii)$ $φ(α) = \sum_i C_{α_i}\, δ(α-α_i)$ corresponding to the general case of parallel-connected elemental CPEs of different orders $α$, and pseudocapacitances $C_α$.

In one model the linear dependence between electrolyte concentration and conductivity is accounted for, while in the other model it is not. A spectral element method is used to discretise the model equations and it is found that the error convergence rate with respect to the number of elements is faster compared to a finite difference method. The increased accuracy of the spectral element approach means that, for a similar level of solution accuracy, the model simulation computing time is approximately 50% of that of the finite difference method. This suggests that the spectral element model could be used for control and state estimation purposes. For a typical supercapacitor charging profile, the numerical solutions from both models closely match experimental voltage and current data. However, when the electrolyte is dilute or where there is a long charging time, a noticeable difference between the numerical solutions of the two models is observed.

Using the $RC$ network equivalency of a CPE, we decompose the total input energy into a contribution stored in the capacitive modes and another dissipated in the resistive modes. Analytical expressions are derived for three test examples: (i) a constant voltage, (ii) a voltage ramp, and (iii) a quadratic input of the form $v(t)=λt^2$. In all cases we found that the ratios of any two of these energy quantities reduce to pure functions of the dispersion coefficient of the CPE, independent of excitation amplitude or material parameters.

Here, we present a theoretical framework to predict EDL charging in arbitrary networks of long pores in the Debye-Hückel limit without restrictions on EDL thickness and pore radii. We demonstrate that electrolyte transport is described by Kirchhoff's laws in terms of the electrochemical potential of charge (the valence-weighted average of the ion electrochemical potentials) instead of the electric potential. By employing this equivalent circuit representation with modified Kirchhoff's laws, our methodology accurately captures the spatial and temporal dependencies of charge density and electric potential, matching results obtained from computationally intensive direct numerical simulations. Our framework provides results up to five orders of magnitude faster, enabling the efficient simulation of thousands of pores within a day.

Low concentration devices present the well-known dye sensitized solar cell (DSSCs) impedance pattern. As the amount of perovskite is increased, the characteristic impedance spectra of thin-film perovskite solar cells (PSCs) arises.

Here we study the manifestations of ion migration in frequency-domain small-signal measurements, focusing on the popular technique of Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). We provide new interpretations for a variety of previously puzzling features, including giant photo-induced low-frequency capacitance and negative capacitance in a variety of forms. We show that these apparently strange measurements can be rationalized by the splitting of AC current into two components, one associated with charge-storage, and the other with the quasi-steady-state recombination current of electrons and holes. The latter contribution to the capacitance can take either a positive or a negative sign, and is potentially very large when slow, voltage-sensitive processes such as ion migration are at play. Using numerical drift-diffusion semiconductor models, we show that giant photo-induced capacitance, inductive loop features, and low-frequency negative capacitance all emerge naturally as consequences of ion migration via its coupling to quasi-steady-state electron and hole currents. In doing so, we unify the understanding of EIS measurements with the comparably well-developed theory of rate dependent current-voltage (I-V) measurements in perovskite cells.

Furthermore, to quantitively compare the values of the tortuosities determined by different methods, the corresponding effective transport coefficients (δ) are compared, which was usually used as a correction for effective diffusivity and conductivity of electrolytes in porous media.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04988v1,"EIS, electrochemical impedance, electrochemical impedance, impedance spectrum, AI, classification",38.9,

Kavanagh",2020,"eess.SY, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.app-ph","This paper focuses on accelerated aging methods for magnet wire. Reliability of electrical devices such as coils, motors, relays, solenoids and transformers is heavily dependent on the Electrical Insulation System (EIS). Accelerated aging methods are used to rapidly simulate the conditions in real life, which is typically years (20,000 hours) depending on the operating conditions. The purpose of accelerated aging is to bring lifetime of an EIS to hours, days or weeks. Shortening the lifetime of an EIS to such an extent, allows for the study of the insulation materials behavior as well as investigate ways to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) for the purpose of predictive maintenance. Unexpected failures in operation processes, where redundancy is not present, can lead to high economical losses, machine downtime and often health and safety risks. Conditions, under which thermal aging methods are generally reported in the literature, typically neglect other factors, owing to the sheer complexity and interdependence of the multifaceted aging phenomena. This paper examines some existing thermal aging tests, which are currently used to obtain data for enamel degradation in order to try to better understand of how the thermal stresses degrade the EIS. Separation of these stresses, which the EIS operate under, can yield a better understanding of how each of the Thermal, the Electrical, the Ambient and the Mechanical (TEAM) stresses behave.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09187v1,"EIS, Transformers, AI, DL",38.9,

Experimental studies, conducted on a variety of PSCs, produce a variety of impedance spectra shapes. However, they all possess common features, the most noteworthy of which is that they have at least two signals, at high and low frequency, with different characteristic responses to temperature, illumination and electrical bias. It is shown, by a combination of experiment and drift-diffusion modelling of the ion and charge carrier transport and recombination within the cell, that these common features are well reproduced by the simulation. In addition, we show that the high frequency response contains all the key information relating to the steady-state performance of a PSC, i.e. it is a signature of the recombination mechanisms and provides a measure of charge collection efficiency. Moreover, steady-state performance is significantly affected by the distribution of mobile ionic charge within the perovskite layer.

After linear sweep voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy, copper electrodeposits are visualized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy in two different porous separators (cellulose nitrate, polyethylene), whose surfaces are modified by layer-by-layer deposition of positive or negative charged polyelectrolytes. Above the limiting current, surface conduction inhibits growth in the positive separators and produces irregular dendrites, while it enhances growth and suppresses dendrites behind a deionization shock in the negative separators, also leading to improved cycle life. The discovery of stable uniform growth in the random media differs from the non-uniform growth observed in parallel nanopores and cannot be explained by classical quasi-steady leaky membrane models, which always predict instability and dendritic growth.

Customarily, J=C*V^n curves indicate the Mott-Gurney law when n=2, or the Child-Langmuir ballistic regime of SCLC when n=3/2. The latter can be often found in perovskite samples.

Using environmental regulatory document retrieval as a case study, we fine-tune ColBERTv2 model on Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) from federal agencies. We evaluate these models across two benchmarks with different semantic structures. Our findings reveal that identical domain adaptation approaches show very different perceived benefits depending on evaluation methodology. On one benchmark, with clearly separated topic boundaries, domain adaptation shows small improvements (maximum 0.61% NDCG gain). However, on the other benchmark with overlapping semantic structures, the same models demonstrate large improvements (up to 2.22% NDCG gain), a 3.6-fold difference in the performance benefit. We compare these benchmarks through topic diversity metrics, finding that the higher-performing benchmark shows 11% higher average cosine distances between contexts and 23% lower silhouette scores, directly contributing to the observed performance difference. These results demonstrate that benchmark selection strongly determines assessments of retrieval system effectiveness in specialized domains.

Combined $\textit{in situ}$ electrochemical and optical experiments were performed on electrochromic $\textit{a}\mathrm{WO}_{3}$ thin films for a wide lithium intercalation range using an optical wavelength of $810~\mathrm{nm}$ ($1.53~\mathrm{eV}$).

However, challenges in operating in the high energy orbit (HEO) rather than low energy orbit (LEO) have restricted their applications. Based on a monostable nonlinear system, this paper proposes a self-contained solution for time-sharing orbit jump and energy harvesting. The joint dynamics of an electromechanical assembly consisting of a nonlinear energy harvester and a switch-mode piezoelectric interface circuit is studied for high-capability energy harvesting. The proposed solution is carried out by utilizing a cutting-edge switch-mode bidirectional energy conversion circuit (BECC), which enables time-sharing dual functions of energy harvesting and vibration exciting. A theoretical model is established based on impedance analysis and multiple time scales method to analyze the stability, frequency response, and phase evolution of the autonomous and nonautonomous nonlinear energy harvesting systems. Particularly, the detailed dynamics for the orbit jumps with vibration exciting mode of BECC are studied. Experiments are performed to validate the full-range orbit jumps with the monostable nonlinear energy harvester. The harvested power after orbit jumps yields a nine-fold increase, compensating for the energy consumption under vibration exciting mode quickly. The proposed solution also refrains the system from extra mechanical or electrical energy sources for orbit jumps, which leads to the first self-contained solution for simultaneous energy harvesting and orbit jump in nonlinear piezoelectric energy harvesting.

Fouda, Ahmed Elwakil, Costas Psychalinos",2023,physics.app-ph,"Supercapacitors are mostly recognized for their high power density capabilities and fast response time when compared to secondary batteries. However, computing their power in response to a given excitation using the standard formulæ of capacitors is misleading and erroneous because supercapacitors are actually non-ideal capacitive devices that cannot be characterized with a single constant capacitance. In this study we show how to estimate accurately the time-domain power and energy of supercapacitors in response to any excitation signal represented in terms of its Fourier series coefficients with the sole knowledge of the frequency-domain impedance parameters of device. The presented theory is first verified and validated with simulations conducted on an equivalent fifth-order RC circuit emulating the behavior of a fractional circuit consisting of a resistance (Rs) in series with a constant phase element (CPE) of fractional impedance ZCPE = 1/Cαsα. Then we do the same for a commercial supercapacitor modeled as an Rs-CPE circuit, and subjected to both a periodic triangular voltage waveform and a random voltage excitation. The results are conclusive and very promising for adopting the proposed procedure to estimate the power and energy performance of supercapacitors in response to real-world charging and discharging signals.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13078v1,AI,38.9,
2109.14341v1,A kernel for PEM fuel cell distribution of relaxation times,Andrei Kulikovsky,2021,physics.chem-ph,"Impedance of all oxygen transport processes in PEM fuel cell has negative real part in some frequency domain. A model function (kernel) for calculation of distribution of relaxation times (DRT) of a PEM fuel cell is suggested. The kernel is designed for capturing impedance with negative real part and it stems from the equation for impedance of oxygen transport through the gas--diffusion transport layer (doi:10.1149/2.0911509jes). Using recent analytical solution for the cell impedance it is shown that DRT calculated with the novel $K_2$ kernel correctly captures the GDL transport peak, while the classic DRT based on the $RC$--circuit (Debye) kernel misses this peak. Employing $K_2$ kernel, analysis of DRT spectra of a real PEMFC is performed. The leftmost on the frequency scale DRT peak represents oxygen transport in the channel, and the rightmost peak is due to proton transport in the cathode catalyst layer. The second, third and fourth peaks exhibit oxygen transport in the GDL, faradaic reactions on the cathode side, and oxygen transport in the catalyst layer, respectively.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14341v1,"AI, DL",38.9,

The charging of such devices has long been interpreted using equivalent circuits and the partial differential equations these give rise to. Here, we discuss the validity of the transmission line (TL) circuit and equation for modeling a single electrolyte-filled pore in contact with a reservoir of resistance $R_{r}$. The textbook derivation of the pore-reservoir impedance $R_r+Z_p$ from the TL equation does not correctly account for ionic current conservation at the pore-reservoir interface. However, correcting this shortcoming leads to the same impedance. We also show that the pore impedance $Z_p$ can be derived directly from the TL circuit, bypassing the TL equation completely. The TL circuit assumes equipotential lines in an electrolyte-filled pore to be straight, which is not the case near the pore entrance and end. To determine the importance of these regions, we numerically simulated the charging of pores of different lengths $\ell_p$ and radii $\varrho_p$ through the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations.

Digital image analysis of the microstructure of the cathode functional layer in four different cells directly confirms the predicted connection between geometrical properties and the impedance response. As in classical catalysis, the electrocatalytic activity is controlled by an effective Thiele modulus, which is the ratio of the surface diffusion length (mean distance from an adsorption site to the triple phase boundary) to the surface boundary layer length (square root of surface diffusivity divided by the adsorption rate constant). The Thiele modulus must be larger than one in order to maintain high surface coverage of reaction intermediates, but care must be taken in order to guarantee a sufficient triple phase boundary density.

A series of electrodes with different formulations and calendering degrees were fabricated at the experimental level. Corresponding three-dimensional manufacturing models were built based on the same experimental manufacturing parameters to generate the digital counterparts of the experimental electrodes that were then used in the electrochemical model. The results of simulations and experiments were compared individually. Among the manufacturing parameters analyzed, we found that the major factors linking manufacturing parameters and electrode performance are the carbon and binder domain (CBD) distribution within the electrode volume, and the electrostatic potential difference between the electrode and the current collector. A well-connected electronic conductive network throughout the electrode is vital for ensuring full utilization of active material, and it was found that increasing calendering degree is effective in reducing interfacial impedance.

Recently, Bayesian optimization has been proposed for optimizing hyperparameters of various machine learning algorithms. Those methods adopt probabilistic surrogate models like Gaussian processes to approximate and minimize the validation error function of hyperparameter values. However, probabilistic surrogates require accurate estimates of sufficient statistics (e.g., covariance) of the error distribution and thus need many function evaluations with a sizeable number of hyperparameters. This makes them inefficient for optimizing hyperparameters of deep learning algorithms, which are highly expensive to evaluate. In this work, we propose a new deterministic and efficient hyperparameter optimization method that employs radial basis functions as error surrogates. The proposed mixed integer algorithm, called HORD, searches the surrogate for the most promising hyperparameter values through dynamic coordinate search and requires many fewer function evaluations. HORD does well in low dimensions but it is exceptionally better in higher dimensions. Extensive evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 for four deep neural networks demonstrate HORD significantly outperforms the well-established Bayesian optimization methods such as GP, SMAC, and TPE.

However, the process of discovering and developing materials with desired properties is often impeded by substantial experimental costs, extensive resource utilization, and lengthy development periods. To address these challenges, modern approaches often employ machine learning (ML) techniques such as Bayesian Optimization (BO), which streamline the search for optimal materials by iteratively selecting experiments that are most likely to yield beneficial results. However, traditional BO methods, while beneficial, often struggle with balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, leading to sub-optimal performance in material discovery processes. This paper introduces a novel Threshold-Driven UCB-EI Bayesian Optimization (TDUE-BO) method, which dynamically integrates the strengths of Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition functions to optimize the material discovery process. Unlike the classical BO, our method focuses on efficiently navigating the high-dimensional material design space (MDS). TDUE-BO begins with an exploration-focused UCB approach, ensuring a comprehensive initial sweep of the MDS. As the model gains confidence, indicated by reduced uncertainty, it transitions to the more exploitative EI method, focusing on promising areas identified earlier. The UCB-to-EI switching policy dictated guided through continuous monitoring of the model uncertainty during each step of sequential sampling results in navigating through the MDS more efficiently while ensuring rapid convergence. The effectiveness of TDUE-BO is demonstrated through its application on three different material datasets, showing significantly better approximation and optimization performance over the EI and UCB-based BO methods in terms of the RMSE scores and convergence efficiency, respectively.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09591v1,"Machine Learning, Bayesian optimization, AI, ML",25.35,

2310.05166v3,A Corrected Expected Improvement Acquisition Function Under Noisy Observations,"Han Zhou, Xingchen Ma, Matthew B Blaschko",2023,"cs.LG, stat.ML","Sequential maximization of expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used policies in Bayesian optimization because of its simplicity and ability to handle noisy observations. In particular, the improvement function often uses the best posterior mean as the best incumbent in noisy settings. However, the uncertainty associated with the incumbent solution is often neglected in many analytic EI-type methods: a closed-form acquisition function is derived in the noise-free setting, but then applied to the setting with noisy observations. To address this limitation, we propose a modification of EI that corrects its closed-form expression by incorporating the covariance information provided by the Gaussian Process (GP) model. This acquisition function specializes to the classical noise-free result, and we argue should replace that formula in Bayesian optimization software packages, tutorials, and textbooks. This enhanced acquisition provides good generality for noisy and noiseless settings. We show that our method achieves a sublinear convergence rate on the cumulative regret bound under heteroscedastic observation noise. Our empirical results demonstrate that our proposed acquisition function can outperform EI in the presence of noisy observations on benchmark functions for black-box optimization, as well as on parameter search for neural network model compression.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05166v3,"Neural Network, Gaussian Process, Bayesian optimization, AI, DL",25.35,

We present SlogGP, a new surrogate model that incorporates bound information and adapts the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function accordingly. Empirical results on a variety of benchmarks demonstrate the benefit of taking prior information about the optimal value into account, and that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing techniques. Furthermore, we notice that even in the absence of prior information on the bound, the proposed SlogGP surrogate model still performs better than the standard GP model in most cases, which we explain by its larger expressiveness.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04744v3,"Bayesian optimization, AI",25.35,

It first employs an RBF-based Bayesian surrogate model to approximate the true function, where the parameters of the RBFs can be adaptively estimated and updated each time a new point is explored. Then it utilizes a model-guided selection criterion to identify a new point from a candidate set for function evaluation. The selection criterion adopted here is a sample version of the expected improvement (EI) criterion.

LFBO directly models the acquisition function without having to separately perform inference with a probabilistic surrogate model. We show that computing the acquisition function in LFBO can be reduced to optimizing a weighted classification problem, where the weights correspond to the utility being chosen. By choosing the utility function for expected improvement (EI), LFBO outperforms various state-of-the-art black-box optimization methods on several real-world optimization problems.

One of the significant contributors to its success is the proliferation of end devices that acted as a catalyst to provide data for data-hungry DL models. However, computing DL training and inference is the main challenge. Usually, central cloud servers are used for the computation, but it opens up other significant challenges, such as high latency, increased communication costs, and privacy concerns. To mitigate these drawbacks, considerable efforts have been made to push the processing of DL models to edge servers. Moreover, the confluence point of DL and edge has given rise to edge intelligence (EI). This survey paper focuses primarily on the fifth level of EI, called all in-edge level, where DL training and inference (deployment) are performed solely by edge servers. All in-edge is suitable when the end devices have low computing resources, e.g., Internet-of-Things, and other requirements such as latency and communication cost are important in mission-critical applications, e.g., health care.

Secondly, this paper presents enabling technologies, such as model parallelism and split learning, which facilitate DL training and deployment at edge servers. Thirdly, model adaptation techniques based on model compression and conditional computation are described because the standard cloud-based DL deployment cannot be directly applied to all in-edge due to its limited computational resources.

This work aims at tackling the issue by proposing a feature hierarchical EI (FHEI), comprising feature network and inference network deployed at an edge server and corresponding mobile, respectively. Specifically, feature network is designed based on feature hierarchy, a one-directional feature dependency with a different scale. A higher scale feature requires more computation and communication loads while it provides a better AI quality.

At the heart of the intelligent control of these AEPs is the policy guiding the sequential experiments, which is to choose the location to carry out the next experiment. In such cases, a balance between exploitation and exploration must be achieved. A Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework with Expected Improvement based (EI-based) acquisition function can effectively search the MDS and guide where to conduct the next experiments so that the underlying relationship can be identified with a smaller number of experiments. The traditional BO framework tries to optimize a black box objective function in a sequential manner by relying on a single model. However, this single-model approach does not account for model uncertainty. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) addresses this issue by working with multiple models and thus considering the uncertainty in the models. In this work, we first apply the conventional BO algorithm with the most popular EI-based experiment policy in a real-life fatigue dataset for steel to predict the fatigue strength of steel. Afterward, we apply BMA to the same dataset by working with a set of predictive models and compare the performance of BMA with the traditional BO algorithm, which relies on a single model for approximation.

First, we introduce effective invariance (EI), a simple and reasonable measure of model invariance which does not rely on image labels. Given predictions on a test image and its transformed version, EI measures how well the predictions agree and with what level of confidence. Second, using invariance scores computed by EI, we perform large-scale quantitative correlation studies between generalization and invariance, focusing on rotation and grayscale transformations.

Convergence guarantees are only valid when the global optimizer of the acquisition function is found at each round and selected as the next query point. In practice, however, local optimizers of an acquisition function are also used, since searching for the global optimizer is often a non-trivial or time-consuming task. In this paper we consider three popular acquisition functions, PI, EI, and GP-UCB induced by Gaussian process regression. Then we present a performance analysis on the behavior of local optimizers of those acquisition functions, in terms of {\em instantaneous regrets} over global optimizers.

Yet DNNs can also be examined at the level of causation, exploring ""what does what"" within the layers of the network itself. Historically, analyzing the causal structure of DNNs has received less attention than understanding their responses to input. Yet definitionally, generalizability must be a function of a DNN's causal structure since it reflects how the DNN responds to unseen or even not-yet-defined future inputs. Here, we introduce a suite of metrics based on information theory to quantify and track changes in the causal structure of DNNs during training. Specifically, we introduce the effective information (EI) of a feedforward DNN, which is the mutual information between layer input and output following a maximum-entropy perturbation. The EI can be used to assess the degree of causal influence nodes and edges have over their downstream targets in each layer. We show that the EI can be further decomposed in order to examine the sensitivity of a layer (measured by how well edges transmit perturbations) and the degeneracy of a layer (measured by how edge overlap interferes with transmission), along with estimates of the amount of integrated information of a layer. Together, these properties define where each layer lies in the ""causal plane"" which can be used to visualize how layer connectivity becomes more sensitive or degenerate over time, and how integration changes during training, revealing how the layer-by-layer causal structure differentiates.

Although researchers have proposed various ways of defining group fairness, most of them only focused on the immediate fairness, ignoring the long-term impact of a fair classifier under the dynamic scenario where each individual can improve its feature over time. Such dynamic scenarios happen in real world, e.g., college admission and credit loaning, where each rejected sample makes effort to change its features to get accepted afterwards. In this dynamic setting, the long-term fairness should equalize the samples' feature distribution across different groups after the rejected samples make some effort to improve. In order to promote long-term fairness, we propose a new fairness notion called Equal Improvability (EI), which equalizes the potential acceptance rate of the rejected samples across different groups assuming a bounded level of effort will be spent by each rejected sample. We analyze the properties of EI and its connections with existing fairness notions. To find a classifier that satisfies the EI requirement, we propose and study three different approaches that solve EI-regularized optimization problems. Through experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed EI-regularized algorithms encourage us to find a fair classifier in terms of EI.

This approach requires training an appropriate meta-classifier, which can be developed based on historical instance selection results from other datasets using reference instance selection methods as a labeling tool. This work proposes constructing the meta-feature space based on properties extracted from the nearest neighbor graph. Experiments conducted on 17 datasets of varying sizes and five reference instance selection methods (ENN, Drop3, ICF, HMN-EI, and CCIS) demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves results comparable to reference instance selection methods while significantly reducing computational complexity. In the proposed approach, the computational complexity of the system depends only on identifying the k-nearest neighbors for each data sample and running the meta-classifier. Additionally, the study discusses the choice of meta-classifier, recommending the use of Balanced Random Forest.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11526v1,"Machine Learning, Random Forest, AI, classification, prediction",23.78,

However, deploying DNN models on resource-constrained edge devices introduces additional challenges, including limited computation/storage resources, dynamic service demands, and heightened privacy risks. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a novel privacy-aware optimization framework that jointly addresses DNN model deployment, user-server association, and model partitioning, with the goal of minimizing long-term average inference delay under resource and privacy constraints. The problem is formulated as a complex, NP-hard stochastic optimization. To efficiently handle system dynamics and computational complexity, we employ a Lyapunov-based approach to transform the long-term objective into tractable per-slot decisions. Furthermore, we introduce a coalition formation game to enable adaptive user-server association and design a greedy algorithm for model deployment within each coalition.

At each BO iteration, the GP hyperparameters are fit to previously-evaluated data by maximising the marginal likelihood. However, this fails to account for uncertainty in the hyperparameters themselves, leading to overconfident model predictions. This uncertainty can be accounted for by taking the Bayesian approach of marginalising out the model hyperparameters.
  We investigate whether a fully-Bayesian treatment of the Gaussian process hyperparameters in BO (FBBO) leads to improved optimisation performance. Since an analytic approach is intractable, we compare FBBO using three approximate inference schemes to the maximum likelihood approach, using the Expected Improvement (EI) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition functions paired with ARD and isotropic Matern kernels, across 15 well-known benchmark problems for 4 observational noise settings. FBBO using EI with an ARD kernel leads to the best performance in the noise-free setting, with much less difference between combinations of BO components when the noise is increased. FBBO leads to over-exploration with UCB, but is not detrimental with EI. Therefore, we recommend that FBBO using EI with an ARD kernel as the default choice for BO.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00894v1,"Gaussian Process, AI, prediction",23.78,

In practice, BO often concentrates evaluations near the current incumbent, causing the surrogate to become overconfident and to understate predictive uncertainty in the region guiding subsequent decisions. We develop a robust GP-based BO via tempered posterior updates, which downweight the likelihood by a power $α\in (0,1]$ to mitigate overconfidence under local misspecification. We establish cumulative regret bounds for tempered BO under a family of generalized improvement rules, including EI, and show that tempering yields strictly sharper worst-case regret guarantees than the standard posterior $(α=1)$, with the most favorable guarantees occurring near the classical EI choice.
  Motivated by our theoretic findings, we propose a prequential procedure for selecting $α$ online: it decreases $α$ when realized prediction errors exceed model-implied uncertainty and returns $α$ toward one as calibration improves.

This paper thus introduces the capability to identify optimum location to add new samples. The location of the infill points is decided by integrating a Gaussian Process-based criteria (""q-EI""), adopted from Bayesian optimization. The consideration of a penalization term to mitigate interaction among samples (in a batch) is crucial to effective integration of the q-EI criteria into AMR. The new AMR method, called AMR with Penalized Batch Bayesian Sampling (AMR-PBS) is tested on benchmark functions, demonstrating better performance compared to Bayesian EGO.

The fully coupled chemo-mechano-damage model presented captures the interplay between mechanical damage and electrochemical behaviours, enabling the quantification of particle cracking and capacity fade.

Surface cracks are found to initiate when a significantly higher lithium concentration accumulates in the core compared to the shell. Interfacial debonding is shown to arise from localised hoop stresses near the core-shell interface, due to greater shell expansion. This debonding develops rapidly, impedes lithium-ion transport, and can lead to more than 10\% capacity loss after a single discharge.

Theoretically, given $N$ users and $M$ devices, we obtain a regret bound of $O((\text{\bf {MIU}}(T,K) + M)\frac{N^2}{M})$, where $\text{\bf {MIU}}(T,K)$ refers to the maximal incremental uncertainty up to time $T$ for the covariance matrix $K$. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm on two applications of automatic model selection, and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the strategy of serving users independently. Moreover, when multiple computation devices are available, we achieve near-linear speedup when the number of users is much larger than the number of devices.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06561v3,"AI, ML",20.0,

Managing distributed intelligence in this context requires Federated Continual Learning (FCL). However, effectively capturing the diverse characteristics of RTS data in FCL systems poses significant challenges, including severely impacting computational and communication resources, escalating energy costs, and ultimately degrading overall system performance. To overcome these challenges, we investigate how the data distribution shift from ideal to practical RTS scenarios affects Artificial Intelligence (AI) model performance by leveraging the \textit{generalization gap} concept. In this way, we can analyze how sampling time in RTS correlates with the decline in AI performance, computation cost, and communication efficiency. Based on this observation, we develop a novel Sample-driven Control for Federated Continual Learning (SCFL) technique, specifically designed for mobile edge networks with RTS capabilities. In particular, SCFL is an optimization problem that harnesses the sampling process to concurrently minimize the generalization gap and improve overall accuracy while upholding the energy efficiency of the FCL framework. To solve the highly complex and time-varying optimization problem, we introduce a new soft actor-critic algorithm with explicit and implicit constraints (A2C-EI).

In response to these issues, this paper introduces socialized learning (SL) as a promising solution, further propelling the advancement of EI. SL is a learning paradigm predicated on social principles and behaviors, aimed at amplifying the collaborative capacity and collective intelligence of agents within the EI system. SL not only enhances the system's adaptability but also optimizes communication, and networking processes, essential for distributed intelligence across diverse devices and platforms. Therefore, a combination of SL and EI may greatly facilitate the development of collaborative intelligence in the future network.

Cathode catalyst layer (CCL) saturation decreases with current density due to a growing liquid pressure gradient.

Thus, the model split inference is proposed to improve the performance of edge intelligence, in which the AI model is divided into different sub models and the resource-intensive sub model is offloaded to edge server wirelessly for reducing resource requirements and inference latency. However, the previous works mainly concentrate on improving and optimizing the system QoS, ignore the effect of QoE which is another critical item for the users except for QoS. Even the QoE has been widely learned in EC, considering the differences between task offloading in EC and split inference in EI, and the specific issues in QoE which are still not addressed in EC and EI, these algorithms cannot work effectively in edge split inference scenarios. Thus, an effective resource allocation algorithm is proposed in this paper, for accelerating split inference in EI and achieving the tradeoff between inference delay, QoE, and resource consumption, abbreviated as ERA. Specifically, the ERA takes the resource consumption, QoE, and inference latency into account to find the optimal model split strategy and resource allocation strategy. Since the minimum inference delay and resource consumption, and maximum QoE cannot be satisfied simultaneously, the gradient descent based algorithm is adopted to find the optimal tradeoff between them. Moreover, the loop iteration GD approach is developed to reduce the complexity of the GD algorithm caused by parameter discretization. Additionally, the properties of the proposed algorithms are investigated, including convergence, complexity, and approximation error. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of ERA is much better than that of the previous studies.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16537v1,AI,20.0,

Among these solvers, exponential integrators (EI) have gained prominence by demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. However, existing high-order EI-based sampling algorithms rely on degenerate EI solvers, resulting in inferior error bounds and reduced accuracy in contrast to the theoretically anticipated results under optimal settings. This situation makes the sampling quality extremely vulnerable to seemingly innocuous design choices such as timestep schedules. For example, an inefficient timestep scheduler might necessitate twice the number of steps to achieve a quality comparable to that obtained through carefully optimized timesteps. To address this issue, we reevaluate the design of high-order differential solvers for DMs. Through a thorough order analysis, we reveal that the degeneration of existing high-order EI solvers can be attributed to the absence of essential order conditions. By reformulating the differential equations in DMs and capitalizing on the theory of exponential integrators, we propose refined EI solvers that fulfill all the order conditions, which we designate as Refined Exponential Solver (RES). Utilizing these improved solvers, RES exhibits more favorable error bounds theoretically and achieves superior sampling efficiency and stability in practical applications. For instance, a simple switch from the single-step DPM-Solver++ to our order-satisfied RES solver when Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) $=9$, results in a reduction of numerical defects by $25.2\%$ and FID improvement of $25.4\%$ (16.77 vs 12.51) on a pre-trained ImageNet diffusion model.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.02157v1,AI,20.0,

Both FHVA and PHVA qualitatively predict compounds EIEs. Weakly interacting systems (bromobenzene, dibromomethane, and trichloromethane) display identical EIE values for both, FHVA and PHVA. Whereas for strongly interacting systems (ethanol and methanol), PHVA estimates slightly smaller EIE compared to FHVA. By employing the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) along with independent gradient model (IGM), it was possible to establish how minimal changes in compounds interaction energy affected carbon and bromine EIEs estimation in dibromomethane. Moreover, SAPT and IGM revealed how in ethanol, apparently insignificant intermolecular interactions possessed an enormous impact in carbon position specific isotope effects, which highlight the importance of solvent effects for strongly interacting compounds.

These models involve a two-phase process: first, injecting noise to transform the data distribution into a known prior distribution, and second, sampling to recover the original data distribution from noise. Among the various sampling methods, deterministic samplers stand out for their enhanced efficiency. However, analyzing these deterministic samplers presents unique challenges, as they preclude the use of established techniques such as Girsanov's theorem, which are only applicable to stochastic samplers. Furthermore, existing analysis for deterministic samplers usually focuses on specific examples, lacking a generalized approach for general forward processes and various deterministic samplers. Our paper addresses these limitations by introducing a unified convergence analysis framework. To demonstrate the power of our framework, we analyze the variance-preserving (VP) forward process with the exponential integrator (EI) scheme, achieving iteration complexity of $\tilde O(d^2/ε)$.

Despite its popularity, the theoretical aspects of this algorithm have not been properly analyzed. In particular, whether in the noisy setting, the EI strategy with a standard incumbent converges is still an open question of the Gaussian process bandit optimization problem. We aim to answer this question by proposing a variant of EI with a standard incumbent defined via the GP predictive mean. We prove that our algorithm converges, and achieves a cumulative regret bound of $\mathcal O(γ_T\sqrt{T})$, where $γ_T$ is the maximum information gain between $T$ observations and the Gaussian process model. Based on this variant of EI, we further propose an algorithm called Improved GP-EI that converges faster than previous counterparts.

The EI step uses a reference model which focuses on spurious correlations to efficiently reach a good environment partition. However, it is not clear how to find such a reference model. In this work, we propose to repeat the EI process and retrain an ERM model on the \textit{majority} environment inferred by the previous EI step. Under mild assumptions, we find that this iterative process helps learn a representation capturing the spurious correlation better than the single step.

However, the current imitation algorithm struggles to achieve both high performance and high in-environment sample efficiency simultaneously. Behavioral Cloning (BC) does not need in-environment interactions, but it suffers from the covariate shift problem which harms its performance. Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) turns imitation learning into a distribution matching problem. It can achieve better performance on some tasks but it requires a large number of in-environment interactions. Inspired by the recent success of EfficientZero in RL, we propose EfficientImitate (EI), a planning-based imitation learning method that can achieve high in-environment sample efficiency and performance simultaneously. Our algorithmic contribution in this paper is two-fold. First, we extend AIL into the MCTS-based RL. Second, we show the seemingly incompatible two classes of imitation algorithms (BC and AIL) can be naturally unified under our framework, enjoying the benefits of both.

Datta",2023,"physics.flu-dyn, cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.soft, nlin.CD, physics.app-ph","Turbulent flows have been used for millennia to mix solutes; a familiar example is stirring cream into coffee. However, many energy, environmental, and industrial processes rely on the mixing of solutes in porous media where confinement suppresses inertial turbulence. As a result, mixing is drastically hindered, requiring fluid to permeate long distances for appreciable mixing and introducing additional steps to drive mixing that can be expensive and environmentally harmful. Here, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome just by adding dilute amounts of flexible polymers to the fluid. Flow-driven stretching of the polymers generates an elastic instability (EI), driving turbulent-like chaotic flow fluctuations, despite the pore-scale confinement that prohibits typical inertial turbulence. Using in situ imaging, we show that these fluctuations stretch and fold the fluid within the pores along thin layers (``lamellae'') characterized by sharp solute concentration gradients, driving mixing by diffusion in the pores. This process results in a $3\times$ reduction in the required mixing length, a $6\times$ increase in solute transverse dispersivity, and can be harnessed to increase the rate at which chemical compounds react by $3\times$ -- enhancements that we rationalize using turbulence-inspired modeling of the underlying transport processes.

In real-world airborne and spaceborne HSI instruments, some empty stripes would appear at certain locations, because platforms do not always maintain a constant programmed attitude, or have access to accurate digital elevation maps (DEM), and the travelling track is not necessarily aligned with the hyperspectral cameras at all times. This makes the enhancement of the acquired HS images from incomplete or corrupted observations an essential task.

A reformulation of the same GP posterior highlights that this complexity mainly depends on how many \emph{unique} historical points are considered. This can have important implication in active learning settings, where the set of historical points is constructed sequentially by the learner. We show that sequential black-box optimization based on GPs (GP-Opt) can be made efficient by sticking to a candidate solution for multiple evaluation steps and switch only when necessary. Limiting the number of switches also limits the number of unique points in the history of the GP. Thus, the efficient GP reformulation can be used to exactly and cheaply compute the posteriors required to run the GP-Opt algorithms. This approach is especially useful in real-world applications of GP-Opt with high switch costs (e.g. switching chemicals in wet labs, data/model loading in hyperparameter optimization). As examples of this meta-approach, we modify two well-established GP-Opt algorithms, GP-UCB and GP-EI, to switch candidates as infrequently as possible adapting rules from batched GP-Opt.

From the perspective of reformulating the Equivariant Imaging based optimization problem via the method of Lagrange multipliers and utilizing plug-and-play denoisers, this novel unsupervised scheme shows superior efficiency and performance compared to the vanilla Equivariant Imaging paradigm. In particular, our FEI schemes achieve an order-of-magnitude (10x) acceleration over standard EI on training U-Net for X-ray CT reconstruction and image inpainting, with improved generalization performance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06764v3,"AI, DL, supervised learning, unsupervised learning",20.0,

In real-world scenarios, pairs of training samples are often expensive or impossible to obtain. By extending Equivariant Imaging (EI) to volumetric single-photon data, we propose a self-supervised learning framework for the SPISR task. Particularly, using the Poisson unbiased Kullback-Leibler risk estimator and equivariance, our method is able to learn from noisy measurements without ground truths. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance with supervised learning and outperforms interpolation-based methods.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02033v1,"AI, supervised learning",20.0,
2105.07026v1,"A Monotone Approximate Dynamic Programming Approach for the Stochastic Scheduling, Allocation, and Inventory Replenishment Problem: Applications to Drone and Electric Vehicle Battery Swap Stations","Amin Asadi, Sarah Nurre Pinkley",2021,"math.OC, cs.AI, cs.LG, math.PR","There is a growing interest in using electric vehicles (EVs) and drones for many applications. However, battery-oriented issues, including range anxiety and battery degradation, impede adoption. Battery swap stations are one alternative to reduce these concerns that allow the swap of depleted for full batteries in minutes. We consider the problem of deriving actions at a battery swap station when explicitly considering the uncertain arrival of swap demand, battery degradation, and replacement. We model the operations at a battery swap station using a finite horizon Markov Decision Process model for the stochastic scheduling, allocation, and inventory replenishment problem (SAIRP), which determines when and how many batteries are charged, discharged, and replaced over time. We present theoretical proofs for the monotonicity of the value function and monotone structure of an optimal policy for special SAIRP cases. Due to the curses of dimensionality, we develop a new monotone approximate dynamic programming (ADP) method, which intelligently initializes a value function approximation using regression. In computational tests, we demonstrate the superior performance of the new regression-based monotone ADP method as compared to exact methods and other monotone ADP methods. Further, with the tests, we deduce policy insights for drone swap stations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.07026v1,"AI, regression",20.0,

Dickey, Ke Huang, Wubin Bai",2024,physics.app-ph,"Bioelectronic implants with soft mechanics, biocompatibility, and excellent electrical performance enable biomedical implants to record electrophysiological signals and execute interventions within internal organs, promising to revolutionize the diagnosing, monitoring, and treatment of various pathological conditions. However, challenges remain in improving excessive impedance at the bioelectronic-tissue interface and thus the efficacy of electrophysiological signaling and intervention. Here, we devise orbit symmetry breaking in MXene (a low-cost scalability, biocompatible, and conductive 2D layered material, that we refer to as OBXene), that exhibits low bioelectronic-tissue impedance, originating from the out-of-plane charge transfer. Furthermore, the Schottky-induced piezoelectricity stemming from the asymmetric orbital configuration of OBXene facilitates interlayered charge transport in the device. In this study, we report an OBXene-based cardiac patch applied on the left ventricular epicardium of both rodent and porcine models to enable spatiotemporal epicardium mapping and pacing, while coupling the wireless and battery-free operation for long-term real-time recording and closed-loop stimulation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13956v1,AI,20.0,
1711.06034v1,An Inkjet Printed Chipless RFID Sensor for Wireless Humidity Monitoring,"Michele Borgese, Francesco Alessio Dicandia, Filippo Costa, Simone Genovesi, Giuliano Manara",2017,physics.app-ph,"A novel chipless RFID humidity sensor based on a finite Artificial Impedance Surface (AIS) is presented. The unit cell of the AIS is composed of three concentric loops thus obtaining three deep and high Q nulls in the electromagnetic response of the tag. The wireless sensor is fabricated using low-cost inkjet printing technology on a thin sheet of commercial coated paper. The patterned surface is placed on a metal backed cardboard layer. The relative humidity information is encoded in the frequency shift of the resonance peaks. Varying the relative humidity level from 50% to 90%, the frequency shift has proven to be up to 270MHz. The position of the resonance peaks has been correlated to the relative humidity level of the environment on the basis of a high number of measurements performed in a climatic chamber, specifically designed for RF measurements of the sensor. A very low error probability of the proposed sensor is demonstrated when the device is used with a 10% RH humidity level discrimination.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.06034v1,AI,20.0,
