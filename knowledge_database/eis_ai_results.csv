2302.03362v2,Machine Learning Benchmarks for the Classification of Equivalent Circuit Models from Electrochemical Impedance Spectra,"Joachim Schaeffer, Paul Gasper, Esteban Garcia-Tamayo, Raymond Gasper, Masaki Adachi, Juan Pablo Gaviria-Cardona, Simon Montoya-Bedoya, Anoushka Bhutani, Andrew Schiek, Rhys Goodall, Rolf Findeisen, Richard D. Braatz, Simon Engelke",2023,"cs.LG, cond-mat.mtrl-sci","Analysis of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data for electrochemical systems often consists of defining an Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM) using expert knowledge and then optimizing the model parameters to deconvolute various resistance, capacitive, inductive, or diffusion responses. For small data sets, this procedure can be conducted manually; however, it is not feasible to manually define a proper ECM for extensive data sets with a wide range of EIS responses. Automatic identification of an ECM would substantially accelerate the analysis of large sets of EIS data. We showcase machine learning methods to classify the ECMs of 9,300 impedance spectra provided by QuantumScape for the BatteryDEV hackathon. The best-performing approach is a gradient-boosted tree model utilizing a library to automatically generate features, followed by a random forest model using the raw spectral data. A convolutional neural network using boolean images of Nyquist representations is presented as an alternative, although it achieves a lower accuracy. We publish the data and open source the associated code. The approaches described in this article can serve as benchmarks for further studies. A key remaining challenge is the identifiability of the labels, underlined by the model performances and the comparison of misclassified spectra.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.03362v2,"EIS, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, Impedance Spectra, Nyquist, Machine Learning, Neural Network, Random Forest",76.72
2510.09662v1,Assessment of different loss functions for fitting equivalent circuit models to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data,"Ali Jaberi, Amin Sadeghi, Runze Zhang, Zhaoyang Zhao, Qiuyu Shi, Robert Black, Zoya Sadighi, Jason Hattrick-Simpers",2025,"cs.LG, cond-mat.mtrl-sci","Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores, chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values. Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09662v1,"EIS, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, Machine Learning, Data-driven",72.74
2410.15271v1,Onboard Health Estimation using Distribution of Relaxation Times for Lithium-ion Batteries,"Muhammad Aadil Khan, Sai Thatipamula, Simona Onori",2024,cs.LG,"Real-life batteries tend to experience a range of operating conditions, and undergo degradation due to a combination of both calendar and cycling aging. Onboard health estimation models typically use cycling aging data only, and account for at most one operating condition e.g., temperature, which can limit the accuracy of the models for state-of-health (SOH) estimation. In this paper, we utilize electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data from 5 calendar-aged and 17 cycling-aged cells to perform SOH estimation under various operating conditions. The EIS curves are deconvoluted using the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) technique to map them onto a function $\textbf{g}$ which consists of distinct timescales representing different resistances inside the cell. These DRT curves, $\textbf{g}$, are then used as inputs to a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based neural network model for SOH estimation. We validate the model performance by testing it on ten different test sets, and achieve an average RMSPE of 1.69% across these sets.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15271v1,"EIS, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy, Neural Network, LSTM",58.64
2101.08049v3,Evaluating uncertainties in electrochemical impedance spectra of solid oxide fuel cells,"Luka Žnidarič, Gjorgji Nusev, Bertrand Morel, Julie Mougin, Đani Juričić, Pavle Boškoski",2021,"stat.CO, cs.LG, stat.AP, stat.ML","Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a widely used tool for characterization of fuel cells and other electrochemical conversion systems. When applied to the on-line monitoring in the context of in-field applications, the disturbances, drifts and sensor noise may cause severe distortions in the evaluated spectra, especially in the low-frequency part. Failure to ignore the random effects can result in misinterpreted spectra and, consequently, in misleading diagnostic reasoning. This fact has not been often addressed in the research so far. In this paper, we propose an approach to the quantification of the spectral uncertainty, which relies on evaluating the uncertainty of the equivalent circuit model (ECM). We apply the computationally efficient variational Bayes (VB) method and compare the quality of the results with those obtained with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Namely, MCMC algorithm returns accurate distributions of the estimated model parameters, while VB approach provides the approximate distributions. By using simulated and real data we show that approximate results provided by VB approach, although slightly over-optimistic, are still close to the more realistic MCMC estimates. A great advantage of the VB method for online monitoring is low computational load, which is several orders of magnitude lower compared to MCMC. The performance of VB algorithm is demonstrated on a case of ECM parameters estimation in a 6 cell solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack. The complete numerical implementation for recreating the results can be found at https://repo.ijs.si/lznidaric/variational-bayes-supplementary-material.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08049v3,"EIS, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy",58.64
2404.11224v2,Analytical results for uncertainty propagation through trained machine learning regression models,Andrew Thompson,2024,"cs.LG, stat.ML","Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly being used in metrology applications. However, for ML models to be credible in a metrology context they should be accompanied by principled uncertainty quantification. This paper addresses the challenge of uncertainty propagation through trained/fixed machine learning (ML) regression models. Analytical expressions for the mean and variance of the model output are obtained/presented for certain input data distributions and for a variety of ML models. Our results cover several popular ML models including linear regression, penalised linear regression, kernel ridge regression, Gaussian Processes (GPs), support vector machines (SVMs) and relevance vector machines (RVMs). We present numerical experiments in which we validate our methods and compare them with a Monte Carlo approach from a computational efficiency point of view. We also illustrate our methods in the context of a metrology application, namely modelling the state-of-health of lithium-ion cells based upon Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) data",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11224v2,"EIS, Machine Learning, SVM, Gaussian Process",52.8
2009.13501v2,"EIS -- a family of activation functions combining Exponential, ISRU, and Softplus","Koushik Biswas, Sandeep Kumar, Shilpak Banerjee, Ashish Kumar Pandey",2020,"cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.NE","Activation functions play a pivotal role in the function learning using neural networks. The non-linearity in the learned function is achieved by repeated use of the activation function. Over the years, numerous activation functions have been proposed to improve accuracy in several tasks. Basic functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, or Softplus have been favorite among the deep learning community because of their simplicity. In recent years, several novel activation functions arising from these basic functions have been proposed, which have improved accuracy in some challenging datasets. We propose a five hyper-parameters family of activation functions, namely EIS, defined as, \[ \frac{x(\ln(1+e^x))^α}{\sqrt{β+γx^2}+δe^{-θx}}. \] We show examples of activation functions from the EIS family which outperform widely used activation functions on some well known datasets and models. For example, $\frac{x\ln(1+e^x)}{x+1.16e^{-x}}$ beats ReLU by 0.89\% in DenseNet-169, 0.24\% in Inception V3 in CIFAR100 dataset while 1.13\% in Inception V3, 0.13\% in DenseNet-169, 0.94\% in SimpleNet model in CIFAR10 dataset. Also, $\frac{x\ln(1+e^x)}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}$ beats ReLU by 1.68\% in DenseNet-169, 0.30\% in Inception V3 in CIFAR100 dataset while 1.0\% in Inception V3, 0.15\% in DenseNet-169, 1.13\% in SimpleNet model in CIFAR10 dataset.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.13501v2,"EIS, Deep Learning, Neural Network",52.8
1908.07849v1,Semi-supervised Sequence Modeling for Elastic Impedance Inversion,"Motaz Alfarraj, Ghassan AlRegib",2019,"physics.geo-ph, cs.LG, eess.SP, stat.ML","Recent applications of machine learning algorithms in the seismic domain have shown great potential in different areas such as seismic inversion and interpretation. However, such algorithms rarely enforce geophysical constraints - the lack of which might lead to undesirable results. To overcome this issue, we have developed a semi-supervised sequence modeling framework based on recurrent neural networks for elastic impedance inversion from multi-angle seismic data. Specifically, seismic traces and elastic impedance (EI) traces are modeled as a time series. Then, a neural-network-based inversion model comprising convolutional and recurrent neural layers is used to invert seismic data for EI. The proposed workflow uses well-log data to guide the inversion. In addition, it uses seismic forward modeling to regularize the training and to serve as a geophysical constraint for the inversion. The proposed workflow achieves an average correlation of 98% between the estimated and target EI using 10 well logs for training on a synthetic data set.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07849v1,"EIS, Machine Learning, Neural Network",52.8
2512.01294v1,"Experimental Methods, Health Indicators, and Diagnostic Strategies for Retired Lithium-ion Batteries: A Comprehensive Review","Song Zhang, Ruohan Guo, Xiaohua Ge, Perter Mahon, Weixiang Shen",2025,"eess.SP, cs.LG","Reliable health assessment of retired lithium-ion batteries is essential for safe and economically viable second-life deployment, yet remains difficult due to sparse measurements, incomplete historical records, heterogeneous chemistries, and limited or noisy battery health labels. Conventional laboratory diagnostics, such as full charge-discharge cycling, pulse tests, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, and thermal characterization, provide accurate degradation information but are too time-consuming, equipment-intensive, or condition-sensitive to be applied at scale during retirement-stage sorting, leaving real-world datasets fragmented and inconsistent. This review synthesizes recent advances that address these constraints through physical health indicators, experiment testing methods, data-generation and augmentation techniques, and a spectrum of learning-based modeling routes spanning supervised, semi-supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised paradigms. We highlight how minimal-test features, synthetic data, domain-invariant representations, and uncertainty-aware prediction enable robust inference under limited or approximate labels and across mixed chemistries and operating histories. A comparative evaluation further reveals trade-offs in accuracy, interpretability, scalability, and computational burden. Looking forward, progress toward physically constrained generative models, cross-chemistry generalization, calibrated uncertainty estimation, and standardized benchmarks will be crucial for building reliable, scalable, and deployment-ready health prediction tools tailored to the realities of retired-battery applications.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01294v1,"EIS, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy",52.8

It consists in first extracting features from both real and imaginary parts of the impedance spectrum. A parametric model is considered in the case of the real part, whereas regression model with latent variables is used in the latter case. Then, a linear regression model using different subsets of extracted features is used fo r the estimation of fuel cell time duration. The performances of the proposed approach are evaluated on experimental data set to show its feasibility.

2002.10620v1,On Reinforcement Learning for Turn-based Zero-sum Markov Games,"Devavrat Shah, Varun Somani, Qiaomin Xie, Zhi Xu",2020,"cs.LG, stat.ML","We consider the problem of finding Nash equilibrium for two-player turn-based zero-sum games. Inspired by the AlphaGo Zero (AGZ) algorithm, we develop a Reinforcement Learning based approach. Specifically, we propose Explore-Improve-Supervise (EIS) method that combines ""exploration"", ""policy improvement""' and ""supervised learning"" to find the value function and policy associated with Nash equilibrium. We identify sufficient conditions for convergence and correctness for such an approach. For a concrete instance of EIS where random policy is used for ""exploration"", Monte-Carlo Tree Search is used for ""policy improvement"" and Nearest Neighbors is used for ""supervised learning"", we establish that this method finds an $\varepsilon$-approximate value function of Nash equilibrium in $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-(d+4)})$ steps when the underlying state-space of the game is continuous and $d$-dimensional. This is nearly optimal as we establish a lower bound of $\widetildeΩ(\varepsilon^{-(d+2)})$ for any policy.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10620v1,"EIS, Reinforcement learning",36.82

In this paper, we propose SpeechEQ, a framework for unifying SER tasks based on a multi-scale unified metric. This metric can be trained by Multitask Learning (MTL), which includes two emotion recognition tasks of Emotion States Category (EIS) and Emotion Intensity Scale (EIS), and two auxiliary tasks of phoneme recognition and gender recognition. For this framework, we build a Mandarin SER dataset - SpeechEQ Dataset (SEQD). We conducted experiments on the public CASIA and ESD datasets in Mandarin, which exhibit that our method outperforms baseline methods by a relatively large margin, yielding 8.0% and 6.5% improvement in accuracy respectively. Additional experiments on IEMOCAP with four emotion categories (i.e., angry, happy, sad, and neutral) also show the proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art of both weighted accuracy (WA) of 78.16% and unweighted accuracy (UA) of 77.47%.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13101v2,EIS,36.82
2507.15862v2,Quantifying Holistic Review: A Multi-Modal Approach to College Admissions Prediction,"Jun-Wei Zeng, Jerry Shen",2025,"cs.LG, cs.CY","This paper introduces the Comprehensive Applicant Profile Score (CAPS), a novel multi-modal framework designed to quantitatively model and interpret holistic college admissions evaluations. CAPS decomposes applicant profiles into three interpretable components: academic performance (Standardized Academic Score, SAS), essay quality (Essay Quality Index, EQI), and extracurricular engagement (Extracurricular Impact Score, EIS). Leveraging transformer-based semantic embeddings, LLM scoring, and XGBoost regression, CAPS provides transparent and explainable evaluations aligned with human judgment. Experiments on a synthetic but realistic dataset demonstrate strong performance, achieving an EQI prediction R^2 of 0.80, classification accuracy over 75%, a macro F1 score of 0.69, and a weighted F1 score of 0.74.

2506.21581v1,Evaluating the Robustness of Dense Retrievers in Interdisciplinary Domains,"Sarthak Chaturvedi, Anurag Acharya, Rounak Meyur, Koby Hayashi, Sai Munikoti, Sameera Horawalavithana",2025,"cs.IR, cs.AI, cs.LG","Evaluation benchmark characteristics may distort the true benefits of domain adaptation in retrieval models. This creates misleading assessments that influence deployment decisions in specialized domains. We show that two benchmarks with drastically different features such as topic diversity, boundary overlap, and semantic complexity can influence the perceived benefits of fine-tuning. Using environmental regulatory document retrieval as a case study, we fine-tune ColBERTv2 model on Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) from federal agencies. We evaluate these models across two benchmarks with different semantic structures. Our findings reveal that identical domain adaptation approaches show very different perceived benefits depending on evaluation methodology. On one benchmark, with clearly separated topic boundaries, domain adaptation shows small improvements (maximum 0.61% NDCG gain). However, on the other benchmark with overlapping semantic structures, the same models demonstrate large improvements (up to 2.22% NDCG gain), a 3.6-fold difference in the performance benefit. We compare these benchmarks through topic diversity metrics, finding that the higher-performing benchmark shows 11% higher average cosine distances between contexts and 23% lower silhouette scores, directly contributing to the observed performance difference. These results demonstrate that benchmark selection strongly determines assessments of retrieval system effectiveness in specialized domains. Evaluation frameworks with well-separated topics regularly underestimate domain adaptation benefits, while those with overlapping semantic boundaries reveal improvements that better reflect real-world regulatory document complexity. Our findings have important implications for developing and deploying AI systems for interdisciplinary domains that integrate multiple topics.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21581v1,EIS,25.91
